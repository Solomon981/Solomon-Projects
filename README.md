Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Unicorn Companies Around the World: 

Project Description:
This project was about performing an exploratory data analysis of Unicorn Companies, with a valuation of $1 billion operating in various countries around the world. The objective was to analyze the dataset and provide recommedations to help Unicorn Companies in creating good business models and making better decisions.

Steps taken to complete the Unicorn Companies EDA project:
1. Download the relevant files for the project assignment and save it as a csv file.
2. Review and clean the file by removing duplicates, separating alphanumeric columns.
3. Open the Python Jupyter notebook for use in data analysis.
4. Import the necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and matolotlib.
5. Upload the csv file with the dataset into Jupyter notebook through the file link under file properties and security.
6. Perform data inspections on the dataset
7. Determine the eight (8) insights and relationships to explore and observe based on the dataset.
8.  Creat visualizations for the dataset, focusing on patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.
9. Create visualization charts and graphs by leveraging lecture notes and Artificial Intelligence tools, and include observations.
10. Copy the charts and graphs and use them to create the powerpoint slides

Challenges faced on the project.

The challenges faced were in the areas of identification of other outliers in the dataset, about two duplicates where removed for the data set. Also, determining the appropriate visualization to present the data was a challenge because the numerical values in the dataset were not being seen. Jupyter notebook consitently retuned error messages saying that some of the columns with numerical data does not exist in the dataframe. After performing inspections to determine the datatype and the datashape, columns that were actually returned by Jupyter notebook as existing columns in the output, were later considered to be non-existing when used for further analysis.
